# Battlesnake Python Starter Project

Made with Python's template for Battlesnake, and hosted on Repl.

My first attempt with a partner on a Snake AI.

### TODO ###

- Find a way for a snake not to corner itself
- So far, our snake is finding any head-to-head collision acceptable, this should be changed so that we only accept beneficial ones
